Getting inspired from some of my previous project and my work in Design and AI at the time of high seas I started working and also teaching something that will  be both useful and people would love to use. 

Just bought a domain after that (which is still inactive due to some issues with the registrar) this idea started. Worked on it in my free time and to make it best written and updated code with the best packages and code style. 

I hope you like this simple yet wonderful Brilliant style educational website!


**For High Seas Checkers**

The other project listed is the time I worked in figma! Feel free to DM me for the figma link :)
